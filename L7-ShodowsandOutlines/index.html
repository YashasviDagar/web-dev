Outlines
An outline is a line that is drawn around elements, outside the borders, to make the element "stand out". It's commonly used for accessibility purposes, like highlighting focused elements.

The Syntax for Outlines is as follows:
outline: width style color;


Differences between Outlines and Borders:
While both can visually appear similar, outlines differ from borders in a few ways:

Position: Outlines don't take up space; they're drawn around the element, outside of any border.
Offset: Using the outline-offset property, you can set the space between an outline and the edge or border of an element.
Width: Borders can have varying widths on different sides, outlines have a uniform width.
Rounded Corners: Borders can have rounded corners using border-radius, while outlines generally cannot. -->
